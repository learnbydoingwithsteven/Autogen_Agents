# Example implementation of research use cases using Autogen with an Ollama local model

"""This module demonstrates how Autogen agents might work with an
Ollama local language model and a simple knowledge graph to streamline
research activities. Each function below represents one of the use cases
outlined in research_use_cases.md.

These functions rely on the hypothetical `ollama` and `autogen` Python
packages. In practice, you would replace the placeholder code with
specific API calls to your own local model and Autogen agent tools.
