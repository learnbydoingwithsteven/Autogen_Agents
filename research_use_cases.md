# Research Use Cases for Autogen with Ollama Local Model

The following list describes ten scenarios where an autogen agent paired with an Ollama local model can streamline research workflows. These concepts are examples of how knowledge graphs and automated agents can accelerate the discovery process and support idea development.

1. **Literature Review Assistant**
   - Generate summaries of large collections of academic papers.
   - Populate a knowledge graph with key entities (authors, institutions, topics) to visualize relationships.

2. **Automated Data Extraction**
   - Use agents to identify and extract datasets from research articles or public repositories.
   - Store metadata in a knowledge graph for easy querying and tracking of provenance.

3. **Topic Mapping for New Ideas**
   - When brainstorming a new project, agents can explore related work and link concepts via a knowledge graph.
   - This helps identify gaps in existing literature and highlight novel connections.

4. **Research Question Generation**
   - Agents analyze trends in the knowledge graph to suggest unexplored or emerging areas of study.
   - Researchers can quickly iterate on these suggestions to refine potential directions.

5. **Collaborative Experiment Planning**
   - Use autogen agents to consolidate experimental protocols from different sources.
   - A knowledge graph can track dependencies, required equipment, or previous outcomes.

6. **Real-Time Citation Suggestions**
   - While drafting papers, an agent monitors text and proposes relevant citations from the knowledge graph.
   - This accelerates writing and ensures proper attribution.

7. **Automated Result Validation**
   - Agents cross-reference claimed results with existing knowledge graphs to flag potential inconsistencies.
   - This can prevent duplication of efforts or highlight contradictory findings.

8. **Cross-Disciplinary Insight Mining**
   - Agents traverse multiple knowledge domains to discover interdisciplinary applications.
   - Researchers can integrate insights that might not be immediately visible within a single field.

9. **Project Management and Task Delegation**
   - A network of agents can track milestones, manage tasks, and coordinate resources for a research team.
   - Status information is stored in the knowledge graph for transparency and accountability.

10. **Long-Term Knowledge Preservation**
    - Agents periodically update and maintain a knowledge graph of all outputs, including negative results.
    - This ensures future researchers can quickly build on the collective work without repeating past mistakes.

These use cases showcase how a local model via Ollama, combined with Autogen's agent ecosystem and a well-structured knowledge graph, can significantly streamline research activities from literature exploration to project management.
