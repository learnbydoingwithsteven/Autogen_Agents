# Autogen Agents

This repository showcases 10 financial-industry examples for [Autogen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) connected to a locally hosted [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) model.

All code is located in the `financial_examples` folder. Each subdirectory contains a `README.md` and `main.py` describing how to run that particular scenario.

See [`financial_examples/README.md`](financial_examples/README.md) for setup instructions and the list of available use cases.
