# Autogen_Agents
This repository demonstrates sample Autogen agents working with an Ollama local model and a simple knowledge graph. Ten example research use cases are organized under the `examples/research/use_cases` directory. Each subfolder contains a small Python script showing how an agent might tackle the scenario. Additional details can be found in `examples/research/research_use_cases.md`.
