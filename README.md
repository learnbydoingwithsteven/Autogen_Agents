# Autogen_Agents
This repository demonstrates sample Autogen agents working with an Ollama local
model and a simple knowledge graph.  Ten example research use cases are
organized under the `use_cases` directory.  Each subfolder contains a small
Python script showing how an agent might tackle the scenario.
